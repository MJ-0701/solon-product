# SFS Context Router

Always keep entry docs small. Read `kernel.md` first, then only the matching
module:

For new work, load `policies/lean-procedure-refactor-pack.md` first (Korean:
`policies/lean-procedure-refactor-pack.ko.md`): five-phase default and legacy compatibility.

## Commands (lifecycle rails)

- `commands/start.md` — start / new sprint / bash-first Next.
- `commands/adopt.md` — adopt existing project / compact baseline / DDD/TDD retrofit / documentation cleanup.
- `commands/profile.md` — profile / SFS.md project overview only.
- `commands/brainstorm.md` — Gate 2 shared understanding before plan.
- `commands/plan.md` — Gate 3 sprint contract and cross-phase fundamentals.
- `commands/implement.md` — implement / build / execute work.
- `commands/review.md` — review / CPO / verdict.
- `commands/capture.md` — minimal evidence primitive for approval / waiver / decision / blocker / external evidence; not a lifecycle step.
- `commands/ingest.md` — purpose-gated raw intake stub before llm-wiki compile.
- `commands/report-bug.md` — file an SFS-product bug to the official gh channel; confirm gate before fix.
- `commands/flowcheck.md` — postflight self-check that SFS ran per documented flow; classify divergence and route product bugs to report-bug.
- `commands/healthcheck.md` — read-only SFS runtime/project drift checker with report-bug draft output.
- `commands/recall.md` — token-zero session recall over session/handoff/PROGRESS logs via grep/date index (read-only).
- `commands/daily.md` — bookend daily operating loop (morning brief + evening recap) composing existing `status`/`recall`/`capture`/`tidy`/`loop`; a routine, not a binary.
- `commands/release.md` — release / deploy / Homebrew / Scoop.
- `commands/upgrade.md` — upgrade / update / install freshness.
- `commands/harness.md` — harness doctor/map for project autonomy readiness.
- `commands/dig.md` — bottom-up excavation of an undocumented codebase: deterministic L0 scan + ERD / L1 graph + queue, capsule-delegated L2 fact cards (validator-enforced evidence), L3 synthesis (#추정-marked reverse-spec + unknowns question list), L4 confirmation states.
- `commands/audit.md` — static read-only security audit of the operator's own repo: deterministic OWASP-family scan (secret/owasp/config/deps/hygiene lenses, secret values redacted), then LLM threat-model / exploit-hypothesis (reasoning only, never execution) / fix; signal-only, defensive-scope only, standing scan surface for `agentic-security-logging-pack.md`. VULNERABILITY_CLASS_CLOSED_LOOP promotes a recurring finding class to a routed rule / skill / regression lock instead of stopping at a waiver; a blanket waiver wide enough to pass a whole class is gate removal, not an exception.
- `commands/tidy.md` — tidy / report / retro / archive.
- `commands/loop.md` — loop / autonomous work / queue.

## Policies — flow, gates, delegation, self-improvement

- `policies/mutex.md` — lock conflict or concurrent session.
- `policies/bug-report-lifecycle.md` — official bug channel, report template, confirm gate, dev-first|hotfix fix routing.
- `policies/flow-conformance-postflight.md` — flowcheck invariant registry + non-collapsing event contract; critical vs advisory + divergence classification. MID_RUN_INTENT_RECHECK adds the in-flight cadence (assumption-change + original-intent recheck at each step boundary; silent forward progress is a drift finding), distinct from the pre-work declaration and the postflight registry. REASONING_LOG_AS_AUDIT_ARTIFACT contracts the judgment trace as the after-the-fact partner to PRE_WORK_INVARIANT_DECLARATION — top risk tier only, reusing DELEGATION_UNIT_LADDER's tiering. IRREVERSIBLE_ACTION_INTENT_GATE adds the action-side layer the class/ingress/fatigue layers all miss: once, immediately before an irreversible action, a checker separate from the executor compares it against the original request (self-report is not a gate); distinct from MID_RUN_INTENT_RECHECK in both timing and actor. RUNTIME_EVIDENCE_COVERAGE declares which runtimes the evidence contract covers **and** which are known-blind, treating a completion claim from an undeclared runtime as unverified.
- `policies/user-override-precedence.md` — explicit user command > SFS default; scoped overrides (wu|sprint|until-revoked) with always-surfaced transitions (#3 guard).
- `policies/zero-knowledge-activation.md` — any state SFS can detect+safely-apply must be reachable via detect→guide→consent(1x)→apply; requiring the user to know a command/flag/manual config edit = design bug. solo default / consent / standalone invariant. Gate 6 review check + activatable-states meta-test enforce it; reference = R5 auto-offer + R2 fallback promotion.
- `policies/context-conflict-gate.md` — detect contradictory directives across loaded context via opt-in `conflict-key`/`stance` markers; `sfs harness doctor` flags any slug declared both allow and deny (consumer `.sfs-local/context/` only). Conflict, not volume, is the real context failure. RIGHTSIZE_CONTEXT_PASS adds the info-only overconstraint lens in the same doctor section: standing directives restated across surfaces (redundant guidance) and a narrative always/never count as trim candidates. STALE_CONTEXT_CANDIDATES adds the time axis in that same section — a local override citing a routed module that resolves nowhere is a stale candidate (info-only, archive-rotate never silent-delete); the "routing doc unchanged while its surface keeps moving" axis stays an operator input, not a check.
- `policies/critical-rule-hook-promotion.md` — classify which documented rules promote from prose (Tier A) to gate/lint (Tier B) to code-enforced hook (Tier C); criteria = severity + mechanical detectability + pre-action interception, with recurrence as escalator. Hooks are the only 100%-enforcement layer.
- `policies/steering-surface-taxonomy.md` — decide WHERE a behavior instruction belongs (entry stub / routed policy / Gate·hook / capsule) by scoring load-timing + compaction + context-cost + authority; "Every time / Never" rules can't be guaranteed by prose and must promote to deterministic enforcement; managed-settings authority tier is by-reference only (solon operator overrides all). RULE_VS_GUARDRAIL separates an inviolable gate (never trimmed, belongs on an enforcement surface) from a narrative advisory (trim candidate), discriminated by what one violation costs.
- `policies/skill-promotion-loop.md` — suggest (never auto-create) skill/command candidates from repeated completed-work patterns; `sfs harness doctor` surfaces signatures recurring 3+ times (consumer logs only, read-only). Success-path twin of `lessons-accumulation.md`; acted on at `tidy`.
- `policies/model-workaround-sunset.md` — model-specific workaround rules carry a model/date source tag (MODEL_TAG_REQUIRED) and surface for sunset review on model change (keep / retire / generalize); untagged behavior workarounds are review findings; tidy surfaces stale-model tags; on swap the new model runs a read-only setup audit of untagged standing instructions (MODEL_UPGRADE_SETUP_AUDIT) and the swap decision is measured head-to-head against a pinned fixed reference repository (MODEL_HEAD_TO_HEAD_ON_UPGRADE).
- `policies/user-context-separation.md` — split context three ways: soul (agent identity, `personas/`) / user (operator, `operator-context.md`) / procedure (routed). Keeps identity thin and gives operator preferences their own home; template ships placeholders only; access/memory scoped per compartment (COMPARTMENT_SCOPING: baseline inherited + per-boundary override, cross-boundary memory non-leak).
- `policies/work-delegation-and-startup.md` — five-factor test for whether work is worth delegating as a WU, restate-and-clarify before starting, and runtime-tier selection (quick chat / assisted session / autonomous code); north star + trust-gated proactive-proposal authority (NORTH_STAR) and human-attention discipline (HUMAN_ATTENTION_IS_SCARCE: batch/repeat/limit-exposure/workload guardrail). 7-step step-1 alignment. DELEGATION_UNIT_LADDER sizes the delegated unit (chunk → task → decision) from trusted verification capped by the surface's risk tier, and a third input — a measurable signal the agent can hill-climb — is what makes an unattended stretch delegable at all. SCHEDULED_RUN_CONTRACT carries a processed-work ledger obligation: a recurring job that keeps no record of what it already handled redoes work every fire, which is a design finding rather than a tuning knob.
- `policies/loop-taxonomy.md` — single decision lens for choosing a loop type: trigger axis (prompt/goal/interval/event) x stop axis (judgment/criteria+turn-cap/cancel/goal-met) → minimum-complexity primitive; four types mapped by-reference (turn→default session, goal→`commands/loop.md` AC+turn-cap, time→SCHEDULED_RUN_CONTRACT, proactive→unattended runners + NORTH_STAR). CHECK_PLACEMENT_LADDER adds the placement axis for verification checks (standalone → embedded → chained → every-change) with repeated invocation as the promotion signal, and HABIT_TO_CONTRACT_CHAINING converts an always-run-Y-after-X habit into a contract, trade-offs stated. PROACTIVE_INTERVENTION_LADDER places the *response* a proactive surface may make — no action / inline note / new candidate / merge into an already-open unit — scored on usefulness, confidence, and whether a human is better suited (HELD_OUT_SCORING reused, no new scorer). ATTENTION_DECAY_ON_BARREN_SURFACES demotes check frequency on surfaces that keep coming back empty, restoring on change or on call, with inviolable gates exempt.
- `policies/self-improvement-loop.md` — the end-to-end map of the five self-improving policies as one cycle (signal -> record -> curate -> propose -> measure -> gate -> apply -> capture-delta); calls each owning policy by-reference and declares the seven cross-cutting invariants once (suggest-only / ledger-authoritative / L-NNN preserved / measured-but-not-sufficient / no code auto-patch / scheduled-run contract / REJECTION_REASON_CAPTURE — a rejected or edited-down suggestion is recorded with a one-line reason, because the correction floor counts and only the reason explains). BE_THE_AGENT_FIRST fixes the standard by hand before automating, and REFLECTION_TO_EVAL_PIPELINE promotes structured manual review into eval cases (judge-agent scored; eval as a cycle-speed instrument; agent tool-gap self-report as SIGNAL). The SIGNAL stage also admits a COMBINED_SIGNAL_WINDOW pair — two different-kind signals about one subject inside one window, each below its own single-source floor.
- `policies/lessons-accumulation.md` — accumulate caught failures as durable avoidance rules in `.sfs-local/lessons.md`; consult on plan/flowcheck, append on failure, Gotchas slot.
- `policies/unknowns-and-deviations.md` — map-vs-territory unknowns quadrant + blind-spot pass (kickoff `blind_spots` states) at plan preflight, prototype fork for unverbalizable direction, impact-ordered spec interview gate, plan `references` field (read-before-implement pointers), conservative deviation log during implementation (lessons SIGNAL input, completion states the ledger), post-implementation explainer/quiz comprehension gate (changed-code-only 3–5 questions), read-only recon pass before high-uncertainty attempts (RECON_RUN_BEFORE_COMMIT), eval-surface blind spot self-report; all signal-only. REFERENCE_FIDELITY_LADDER ranks references — behaving artifact > frozen depiction > prose, with a rubric as the quality rung.
- `policies/external-orchestrator-entry.md` — headless external orchestrator (Hermes-class) entry contract; inviolable gates, file-bus reporting, first-permission read-only. ADVISOR_STRATEGY_BINDING makes selective advisor coaching a configured binding: call conditions (stuck / verification gate — ship-eve evaluation being the representative point / low-confidence) live beside `agent_runtime_bindings`, cost compared per task.
- `policies/harness-autonomy.md` — project harness diagnosis, map, artifacts, human boundary, and autonomy loop; team roster as an explicit artifact (owns/scope/tools) and verifier!=implementer extended to "verification capability is the precondition for expanding autonomy"; FIX_THE_LOOP_NOT_THE_CODE (rule upstream + batch regen, no hand-patch), JUDGE_NEGATIVE_CONTROL (judge must fail on broken fixture), BOUNDS_OUTLIVE_MODEL_LIMITS (boundaries from operator permission, not model limits); SPEC_IS_THE_ARTIFACT (verified artifact == executed artifact, no translation layer) and CONTROL_LOGIC_AS_DATA (routines/transitions/gates on an inspectable data surface, never implicit control flow); APPROVAL_FATIGUE_DECAY is the quantitative twin of INVARIANT_LIVES_IN_HARNESS — a per-step human gate's detection power falls as the session runs, so approval is not the safety argument that keeps a standing rule in a prompt.
- `policies/division-subagent-council.md` — five organization divisions plus the taxonomy cross-cutting product function/lens as six required council roles.
- `policies/mainline-focus-guard.md` — keep helper tool/setup work subordinate to the main objective.
- `policies/ai-work-intake-routing.md` — four-part AI work intake and one-off/repeated/batch routing.
- `policies/credential-hygiene.md` — placeholders only on agent-visible surfaces; real keys live in one store, attach at the boundary per-consumer-scoped, rotate in one place; unattended runners get keys via env at spawn; agent acts as itself (AGENT_IDENTITY: service account, revoke-by-identity kill switch) and grants widen by audit not guess (GRANT_LIFECYCLE: baseline -> events.jsonl/tool_call audit -> one justified grant); FOUR_QUESTION_RISK_PREFLIGHT decision lens before wiring any new connector/MCP/tool (untrusted ingest / actions+identity / blast radius / observability, zero-untrusted-ingest fast path). INGRESS_TRUST_CHECKPOINT is the runtime counterpart of the preflight — a per-touch injection check at every untrusted-content boundary, with the hijack assumed and bounded. NEVER_APPROVE_CLASS is the layer above judge/allow: classes never routed to discretion (credential/source exfiltration; OUTBOUND_COMMUNICATION_NEVER_AUTO for any message addressed to a person), declared as config data and not unlockable by a user request.

## Policies — token / context / session hygiene

- `policies/harness-readiness.md` — AI-readiness (Sanity) audit: 4-axis 0-2 rubric in `sfs harness doctor`, AI-friendly surface axis group (repo-standard 4-element mapping), `.sfs-local/readiness-waiver`, readiness-before-cartography order discipline, knowledge graphs as opt-in pointers only (all signal-only).
- `policies/harness-maturity.md` — AI maturity self-diagnosis: 5-level impact ladder in `sfs harness doctor` (delegated-wu / review-loop / parallel-capsule / rework signals), adoption != impact, onboarding starts with locating the current level (signal-only).
- `policies/token-harness.md` — token/context hygiene, semantic search, repeated mistake guardrails; KNOB_DIAGNOSTIC_LADDER (failure escalation: context/skills → effort ↑ → model tier ↑, routine stretches downshift, route-unknown recon takes the strong tier); SERIALIZE_EXPENSIVE_OPS (full build/test at one serialization point, workers write patches only). KNOB_DIAGNOSTIC_LADDER routes from a record — task completion ratio x cost per task — rather than from feel, and enters on cost per outcome, not cost per token (what would this have cost with no agent, counting work that would not have happened; is this hard work or merely a lot of work).
- `policies/runtime-token-firewall.md` — capsule-only worker/review handoff and no full-history forwarding.
- `policies/sub-agent-capsule-contract.md` — structured field contract (goal/ac/files_scope/tools_allowed/output_paths/token_budget/timeout/pii_rules) for that capsule handoff; verb-grain least agency (irreversible verbs removed = by-construction block), done = artifact on disk (queue re-derived, resume by construction), shared-surface conflict scan preflight. CONSTRAIN_ORCHESTRATION_FREE_JUDGMENT keeps constraints on the orchestration layer and leaves the judgment interval open; SUBAGENT_TIER_DEFAULT points at the routing binding, with effort allocated per pipeline stage at issue time (low for routing/extraction/summary, high for final judgment and review).
- `policies/session-continuation-guard.md` — stop long-session token bleed with fresh-session handoff.
- `policies/context-pollution-guard.md` — keep core docs/context free of prompt bodies, transcripts, and scratch residue.
- `policies/md-line-budget.md` — 200-line ceiling for loadable md (routed context / top-level docs / operational logs / user long-form); warn(180)/partial(200)/fail(250) + archive rotation + harness `md-line-budget-violation`/`operational-log-lag` detectors; ARTIFACT_FITS_IN_HEAD names the shared design rationale behind the budget, thin entry, and capsule decomposition; ko mirror at `policies/md-line-budget.ko.md`.
- `policies/search-tooling.md` — agents default to `rg` (ripgrep) for code/text search, `grep` only as fallback; ast-grep / Aider evaluated PASS for the SFS core (bash+Markdown majority) and stay opt-in consumer-project extensions; ko mirror at `policies/search-tooling.ko.md`.

## Policies — knowledge, citation, docs discipline

- `policies/source-pointer-citation.md` — cite external knowledge by namespaced pointer (`idea_wiki:LNNN-In`), never by content copy; advisory, runtime-independent, consumer placeholder. PROOF_CARRYING_FINDING generalizes the dig-card evidence rule to every review/audit finding (no checkable pointer → reported as a hypothesis). ANTAGONISTIC_RESEARCH_PASS turns the same rule on the agent's own research: one refutation pass after research and before implementation, trace recorded in the plan — distinct from HONEST_UNKNOWNS (say what you do not know) and BLIND_SPOT_PASS (ask what was never said).
- `policies/skill-catalog-discipline.md` — audit routed commands/policies against a nine-category skill lens to find coverage gaps; keep `load_when` trigger-centric (lint-locked); on-demand guardrail candidates (`/careful`, `/freeze`); setup-via-placeholder cross-link. SHADOW_MODE_TRUST_LADDER runs a new automated reviewer/skill suggest-only until its findings hold up, then keeps a post-promotion sampling audit; GENERALIZATION_BEFORE_SHARING is the precondition on the promotion edit — parameterize the one-project particulars (paths, project names, personal routines) or hold the promotion. VERSIONED_EXTENSION_SURFACE asks of any new capability whether it is a core change or a versioned extension — without an extension path the pressure lands in the core.
- `policies/doc-colocation-provenance.md` — change routed-context docs in the same change (colocation); machine-lock literal `_INDEX` routes against broken links (forward direction stays a review-lens flag); reference-doc skeleton (Grain/Scope/Usage/Gotchas/Cross-Ref); five-field provenance footer SSoT.
- `policies/agent-adapter-doc-refactor.md` — keep root LLM agent docs frontmatter-only and auto-refactor recognized SFS adapter bloat.
- `policies/sfs-router-doc-refactor.md` — keep `SFS.md` as a thin router and auto-refactor recognized policy dumps.
- `policies/domain-knowledge-assets.md` — turn expert domain know-how into AI-usable assets.
- `policies/domain-ontology-discipline.md` — keep domain entities/relationships compiled and reconciled on change; backs the ontology review lens.
- `policies/source-driven-development.md` — official-source verification for framework/library patterns.
- `policies/writing-discipline.md` — user-facing artifact writing discipline (no preamble / hedging / self-congratulation / re-statement / filler conclusions); ko mirror at `policies/writing-discipline.ko.md`.
- `policies/obsidian-llm-wiki.md` — recommended Obsidian LLM wiki setup for SFS project continuity.
- `policies/wiki-mission-checklist-skill.md` — live wiki checklist for long-context follow-through.

## Policies — engineering disciplines

- `policies/debugging-and-error-recovery.md` — stop-the-line failure triage and root-cause guardrails.
- `policies/deprecation-and-migration.md` — legacy state/API cleanup with replacement, archive, and migration evidence.
- `policies/shipping-and-launch.md` — reversible, observable release/deploy checklist.

- `policies/review-lens-routing.md` — review lens aliases and split knowledge-pack loading.
- `policies/agent-build-review-lens.md` — review lens for work shipping AI agents / MCP servers / sub-agent harnesses (`lens:agent-build`); failure modes generic code review misses.
- `policies/knowledge-pack-router.md` — knowledge pack / review lens router (English).
- `policies/knowledge-pack-router.ko.md` — knowledge pack / review lens router (Korean).

- `policies/lean-procedure-refactor-pack.md` — five-phase default / artifact ownership / one human review / risk triggers / conditional ADR / legacy 7-step compatibility; keep/shrink/remove procedural bottlenecks.
- `policies/*-knowledge-pack.md` — English compact guidance packs for each lens/pack.
- `policies/*-knowledge-pack.ko.md` — Korean compact guidance packs for each lens/pack.
- `policies/*.ko.md` (general rule) — every `*.ko.md` is the Korean mirror of its same-named en policy; load the mirror when the session/workspace language is Korean. Mirrors keep their en counterpart's ASCII anchor tokens (uppercase section ids and check ids) verbatim; heading prose may be localized, so cross-reference by anchor token, not heading text.
- `policies/*-knowledge-pack-*.md` — split child packs loaded only after a parent pack activates matching ids.
- Backend split children: `backend-knowledge-pack-runtime*`, `backend-knowledge-pack-transactions*`, `backend-knowledge-pack-integration*`, `backend-knowledge-pack-operating*`.
- Beginner design intake: `policies/design-intake-flow.md`; use
  `policies/design-intake-flow.ko.md` for Korean.
- Design split children: `design-knowledge-pack-operating*`.
